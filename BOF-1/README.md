From the source code, we can see `win()` is the one who prints out the `flag`! But the problem is `main()` calls the `vuln()` function which then does not calls the `win()` function!

So, our goal is to call `win()` function and execute it in program.

Lets run our binary normally.
```
# ./vuln 
Please enter your string: 
Hey!GiveMeFlag.
Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x804932f

# checksec --file=vuln
[*] '/root/ELF-Exploitation/BOF-1/vuln'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    No canary found
    NX:       NX unknown - GNU_STACK missing
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
    Stack:    Executable
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```
From above output, we can see that `./vuln` asks for `user input` and then just finishes! Also, from output of `checksec` we can see there is `No canary found` means we can control the registers available on the stack.

#### Stack layout:

[Image Link]()

Suppose, we will provide `AAA...` in user input, after 32 characters it will start overwrite next elements on the stack.

Here our goal would be to overwrite the `return Address` which is before the `Saved %ebp`  in stack.

Lets use GDB tool and see where that address lies.
