Here, our goal would to modify the `retAddr` to `win()` function instead of `main()` functions instructions.

But to get `flag` printed in console, we have to satishfy 2 conditions which are:
`arg1` should be `0xCAFEF00D` &
`arg2` should be `0xF00DF00D`

So, we have to call the `win()` function with 2 arguments.

Lets see how we can achieve that. See below image.

Here, we have to alter the `retAddr` and also have to place the `function arguments` on the stack. 

To find address of win(), we can use `gdb`.

[winAddr]()

#### Payload creation:
```
payload => 'A'*100 + 'B'*8 + 'C'*4 + 'retAddr to win()' + 'argument1' + 'argument2'
payload => 'A'*100 + 'B'*8 + 'C'*4 + '0x08049296' + '0xcafef00d' + '0xf00df00d'
```
